    "For Part 1, we will be using data from [this paper](https://ojs.aaai.org/index.php/ICWSM/article/view/7355). The data is a collection of reviews from [Pitchfork](https://pitchfork.com/), a site that provides expert reviews of music album. The authors of this paper have also combined the data with a set of features from [Spotify’s API](https://developer.spotify.com/documentation/web-api/) that provide insight into the music itself, e.g. the \"acousticness\" of the song.  We will tackle a regression problem here, trying to predict the score of a review from several of the other columns in the dataset.\n",
